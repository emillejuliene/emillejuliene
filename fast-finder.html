                    <p>After gathering all of the responses, we have created an affinity diagram to synthesize our
                        findings and insights. The team was able to verify our problem statement with the following:</p>
                    <ul class="list-in pb-3">
                        <li > Students have no access to the faculty room, so they usually wait outside until the person
                            they're looking for comes out. They are sometimes frustrated because they find this
                            time-consuming.</li>

                        <li class="pt-2">
                            There are times that the students are not sure if the person they're looking for is inside
                            the
                            faculty room or campus. So they ask other employees for that person's location, but
                            sometimes
                            the employees would also be unaware of their colleague's whereabouts or availability. </li>

                        <li class="pt-2"> In some scenarios, employees would be busy teaching their classes, attending meetings, or
                            doing
                            other tasks. They are unable to deal with a student right away due to these reasons.</li>

                    <p>Our team used brainstorming methods such as rapid ideation and storyboarding to identify our
                        primary users and produce possible features of the application.

                    <p>Then we deepened our understanding of the structure of our application by
                        creating
                        user flows
                        and low-fidelity wireframes. The sample diagram below shows the steps of a user logging-in,
                        navigating the application, and paging an employee.

                    <p>At this stage, I took the lead in developing an interactive prototype using HTML, CSS, and
                        Bootstrap Framework. We decided to go for a mobile-responsive web application since our research
                        shows that most of our users are smartphone users.

                    <p>To ensure that our design is usable and useful, we asked several students and employees to
                        evaluate our prototypes by doing a test run. Here is the list of feedback we have received:

                            their dashboard or the application's directory.

                        <p>Whenever an employee's status is Available, students can use the pager feature to call the
                            attention of the person they need. The employee will receive a notification once paged.

                            colleagues that a student is looking for them.

                            accidentally forget their IDs at home. Our application allows an employee to manually
                            update
                            their status so students can still get real-time updates.

                    <p>My teammates and I successfully defended our thesis project in October 2017 with
                        minor
                        revisions. The developed application was later deployed in STI College Cubao in February 2018
                        and won
                        the
                        Best IT Special (Thesis) Project.</p>

                    <p>As for my first time designing an application, here are my key takeaways from this experience:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-in">
                        <li><strong>Design is a data-driven process.</strong> Therefore, it is important to validate all
                            assumptions
                            first before jumping into the visual design or writing any line of code.</li>
                        <li class="pt-2"><strong>Reiteration helped us see what design opportunities we may have
                                missed.</strong> This process made
                            our
                            design more aligned with our end-users needs.</li>
                    </ul>
