                        </h2>
                        <p>The first step is to gain an understanding of what my client and his target audience needs. I
                            conducted an in-depth interview with Mike, my client, through Zoom. Our discussion helped me
                            gain a better grasp of what kind of vision he wants for his website. Here are some of the
                            questions asked from the interview:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Which platforms do you showcase your works?</li>
                            <li>How do you gain clients, and how did the pandemic affect your career?</li>
                            <li>How can clients book with your services?</li>
                            <li>How do you manage appointments with your clients?</li>
                            <li>Do you feel satisfied or unsatisfied
                                with your current business process?</li>
                            <li>What are the struggles you have encountered with dealing business with your clients?
                            </li>
                            <li>What type of services do you offer?</li>
                            <li>Can you describe your ideal portfolio website?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I also asked him if he could help me reach out and interview some of his previous clients.
                            During this stage, I considered that having additional insights from Mike's clients could
                            help me identify other design opportunities I might have missed. Through this, I got the
                            chance to know more about what kind of clients Mike had. Also, how he deals with his current
                            business process.</p>

                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                        <p>From what I have gathered during the empathize stage, my findings indicate the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>12 out of 12 clients prefer using their smartphones on browsing the internet. </li>
                            <li>4 out of 12 respondents were recurring clients.</li>
                            <li>12 out of 12 clients are already friends with Mike on social media before discovering
                                his Facebook and Instagram page.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To book a service with MNDZ Studio, the potential client usually sends a direct message to
                            Mike through Facebook or Instagram. From there, Mike and his client set a meeting to discuss
                            pricing, dates, and other business-related inquiries.
                        </p>
                        <p>Problem #1: Due to being preoccupied with work and attending business and personal matters,
                            my client is worried that he finds himself unable to respond immediately to his client's
                            messages. Our solution should deliver a way for potential clients to view information such
                            as pricing, vacant schedules and set appointments on their own to reduce waiting time.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, my client used to hand out calling cards in events to expand his client network.
                            From doing event shoots such as weddings and birthday celebrations, he now only accepts
                            product shoots to ensure his and his client's safety from the virus.</p>
                        <p>Problem #2: Mike has fewer client bookings as to what he usually had before the pandemic. His
                            career was affected by the pandemic lockdowns, and he had to limit his services. Our goal is
                            to deliver a solution that would help him gain more clients without risking his safety from
                            the COVID-19 virus.</p>

                    <p>I started to create user flows and lo-fi wireframes for my client's website. With the research
                        findings showing that most clients are smartphone users, our goal is to ensure that the design
                        is responsive. I used Figma to create two sets of wireframes, one each for the desktop and
                        mobile versions.

                    <p>In between prototyping and testing, we also started to create the visual language for MNDZ
                        Studio. My client specifically wanted a minimalist theme, so I had put together color palette
                        options on placeholder mockups to help him choose during this selection. My client wanted a dark
                        color scheme, so we went for the third option.</p>

                    <p>I conducted the same process for font selection. I used the same placeholder mockup to present
                        the font pairing options to my client, and we decided that Ubuntu and Open Sans are the best fit
                        for his style.</p>

                    <p>Being a solo designer stuck in the middle of a pandemic— the step I found challenging the most
                        was to search for random individuals who will test out my design. Then I discovered Maze, a
                        platform used for remote testing. </p>
                    <img src="/assets/img/Maze Home.png" class="img-fluid " alt="">

                    <p>I decided to run a guerilla test with this platform. Maze help researchers run surveys and
                        validate design ideas through missions. And with my prototype and script ready, setting up
                        everything was quick and easy.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/assets/img/Maze.png" class="img-fluid " alt="">
                    <p>Next, I gathered some online acquaintances who were willing to help me with this activity and
                        provide feedback on the design. Our goal was to make sure potential viewers can navigate easily
                        through the website. And the results showed that all seven testers found the design intuitive.

                    <ul>
                        <li>"User-friendly!"</li>
                        <li>"The design is great if the goal is a minimalist theme. Maybe try testing other fonts and
                            color theme, I guess."</li>
                        <li>"I love the minimalistic UI, especially when you know when to navigate/swipe further. In
                            terms of sequence, maybe arrange the pricing in ascending order while seamlessly go back to
                            the lowest price (loop back to lowest from highest price)."

                    <p>After doing a couple of design iterations based on the feedback, and the visual language in
                        place, I successfully provided my client the final deliverables— the high-fidelity prototypes
                        for MNDZ Studio's website. Overall, my client was happy and satisfied with the design and will
                        be pushing through its development sometime in 2021.</p>

                    <p>From this project, I have learned that testing from the early stages will save you a lot of time.
                        Unlike doing user-interface design right away, testing, then having to do numerous design
                        revisions, I focused on assessing the created user flows and initial prototypes first. Once
                        that's settled, it is much easier to get into the right visual direction of what your client
                        wants.</p>
