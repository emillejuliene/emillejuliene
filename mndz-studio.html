                        conducted an in-depth interview with Mike, my client, through Zoom. <strong> Our discussion
                            helped me
                            gain a better grasp of what kind of vision he wants for his website.</strong> Here are

                        got the
                        chance to know more about what kind of clients Mike had. Also, how he deals with his current

                            Mike through Facebook or Instagram. From there, Mike and his client set a meeting to

                            pricing, dates, and other business-related inquiries.

                        options on placeholder mockups to help him choose during this selection. My client wanted a

                    <p class="text-jstfy">Being a solo designer stuck in the middle of a pandemic— the step I found
                        challenging the
                        most
                        was to search for random individuals who will test out my design. Then I discovered Maze, a
                        platform used for remote testing.
                        <img src="assets/img/Maze Home.png" class="imgs-fluid mx-auto d-block pt-md-5" alt="">
                    </p>


                    <p class="text-jstfy">I decided to run a guerilla test with this platform. Maze help researchers run
                        surveys and
                        validate design ideas through missions. And with my prototype and script ready, setting up
                        everything was quick and easy.

                    <p class="text-jstfy">Next, I gathered some online acquaintances who were willing to help me with
                        this activity and
                        provide feedback on the design. Our goal was to make sure potential viewers can navigate
                        easily
                        through the website. And the results showed that all seven testers found the design
                        intuitive.

                        Others voted for three and four stars.

                            suggestions that
                            may help us
                            improve the design structure.</strong> Here are some of the feedback we received:</p>

                            terms of sequence, maybe arrange the pricing in ascending order while seamlessly go back
                            to
                            the lowest price (loop back to lowest from highest price)."

                    <p class="text-jstfy">After doing a couple of design iterations based on the feedback, and the
                        visual language in
                        place, I successfully provided my client the final deliverables— the high-fidelity
                        prototypes
                        for MNDZ Studio's website. Overall, my client was happy and satisfied with the design and
                        will
                        be pushing through its development sometime in 2021.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-jstfy">From this project, I have learned that <strong> testing from the early stages
                            will save you a
                            lot
                            of time. </strong>
                        Unlike doing user-interface design right away, testing, then having to do numerous design
                        revisions, I focused on assessing the created user flows and initial prototypes first. Once
                        that's settled, it is much easier to get into the right visual direction of what your client
                        wants.</p>
